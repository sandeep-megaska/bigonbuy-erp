-- 0025_fix_hr_upsert_signatures.sql
-- HISTORY ALIGNMENT PLACEHOLDER
--
-- Why this exists:
-- Remote database migration history contains version "0025" as applied,
-- but the original migration file is missing from the repository.
-- Supabase CLI requires local migration files to include all remote versions.
--
-- This file is intentionally a no-op to restore local/remote alignment.
-- Do NOT delete without also repairing remote migration history.
